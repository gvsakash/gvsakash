I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at Georgia Tech advised by James Hays and Judy Hoffman. My interests lie in computer vision, primarily in object recognition. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and my B.A. in Cognitive Science from the University of Georgia.
This summer and the last I interned at Argo AI, where I am helping to solve some of the challenging problems for self-driving cars. In summer 2018, I worked at UC Berkeley with Fisher Yu and colleagues to develop Scalabel, a tool to help accelerate the annotation of object tracks in videos.
In my spare time, I plan and run Dungeons & Dragons adventures, read science fiction, play piano, and play co-op games with my friends.

Hello! I'm Sarang Gupta, a graduate student at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University. I completed my undergraduate education from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with a dual degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering (BEng) and General Business Management (BBA). For the past two years I was working at Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong as an Analyst in the operations division. Prior to my stint at Goldman Sachs, I interned in the technology division of UBS, Hong Kong.

My interest primarily lies in the intersection of Data Science, Machine Learning and Finance. I made this website to consolitdate the work that I have done over the past years. Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to know more about my endeavors, or if you would like to collaborate on any projects.

Here are a few newsletters and brochures I have been featured in:
