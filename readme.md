### Hey! Akash here. ü¶â
> Website: [gvsakash.github.io](gvsakash.github.io)

I'm a CS grad student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, at Northwestern University. My primary interest lies in expanding my diverse repertoire to galvanize decision strategy and generate actionable insights. 

I bring deep technical expertise & hands-on experience in Data Science, Analytics, Software Dev, Neural Nets and Robotics; having explored many specialized projects across various domains. I've collaborated with some of the leading researchers, professionals and clientele in past few years to deliver highly tailored data-driven solutions, bridging the gap from research to effective real-world deployment. 

In short, I've worked as a Data Scientist, Software Developer & ML / Data Engineer. To know more, check out my **[Portfolio here](https://github.com/gvsakash/gvsakash/blob/master/projects.md)**. 

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:gvsakash@u.northwestern.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gvsakash). Always open for interesting chats and collaboration!
