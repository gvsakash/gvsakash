### Hi! I'm Akash 👋

I'm a CS graduate (AI Specialization), at Northwestern University. My primary interest lies in expanding my diverse repertoire to galvanize decision strategy and generate actionable insights. I bring deep technical expertise & hands-on experience in Data Science/Analytics, Software Dev, Neural Nets and Robotics; having explored many specialized projects across various domains. 

I've collaborated with some of the best researchers , professionals and clientele in past few years to deliver highly tailored data-driven solutions, bridging the gap from research to effective real-world deployment.
