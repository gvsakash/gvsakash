### Hi! Akash here. 🦉

I'm a CS grad student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University. My primary interest lies in expanding my repertoire to galvanize decision strategy and generate actionable insights. 

I bring deep technical expertise & hands-on experience in Data Science & Analytics, Software Development, DL and NLP; having explored specialized projects across various domains. I've collaborated with some of the leading researchers, professionals and various clientele in past few years to deliver highly tailored data-driven solutions, bridging the gap from research to effective real-world deployment. 

In short, I've worked as a Data Scientist, Software/ML Engineer. To know more, check out my page **[here](https://gvsakash.github.io)**. 

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:gvsakash@u.northwestern.edu) or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gvsakash). Always open for interesting chats and collaboration!
